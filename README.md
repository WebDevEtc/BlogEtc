# Webdevetc BlogEtc

 - Quickly add a blog with admin panel to your existing Laravel project. It has everything included (routes, views, controllers, middlware, etc)
 - Works with latest version of Laravel.
 
# Next version - coming soon

 - A rewrite of a lot of the code will be released soon. The work for this is now on the `blogetc-next-version` branch. Code there is liable to change. 
 - May 2020: I am importing some of the changes from next version (including tests). I am slowly introducing these new features. Tests currently have a few skipped tests just to make migration of test code later a bit easier.

   - install with composer,
   - do the database migration, copy the config file over (done with `php artisan vendor:publish`)
   - chmod/chown the `public/blog_images/` directory so featured images can be uploaded for each blog post
   - and then add 1 method to your `\App\User` file (`canManageBlogEtcPosts()`
   - __but please see the install instructions to get everything up and working__

## How to customise the blog views/templates

This is easy to do, and further detail can be found in our  [BlogEtc Laravel Blog Package Documentation](https://webdevetc.com/laravel/packages/blogetc-blog-system-for-your-laravel-app/help-documentation/laravel-blog-package-blogetc#guide_to_views).

After doing the correct `vendor:publish`, all of the default template files will be found in /resources/views/vendor/blogetc/ and are easy to edit to match your needs.

## Built in CAPTCHA / anti spam

There is a built in captcha (anti spam comment) system built in, which will be easy for you to replace with your own implementation.

  Please see [our Captcha docs](https://webdevetc.com/laravel/packages/blogetc-blog-system-for-your-laravel-app/help-documentation/laravel-blog-package-blogetc#captcha) for  more details.
