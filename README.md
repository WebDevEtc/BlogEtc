# Recent changes (May/June 2020) including recent installation instructions:

 - This package no longer uses `\App\User::canManageBlogEtcPosts()` to check if a user can access the admin panel. 
 - Instead it now uses a Laravel gate. This is currently backwards compatible without any edits. 
 - For new installations please add the following to `App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider`:
 
 ```php
    Gate::define(GateTypes::MANAGE_BLOG_ADMIN, static function (?Model $user) {
        // Implement your logic here, for example:
        return $user && $user->email === 'your-admin-user@your-site.com';
        // Or something like `$user->is_admin === true`
    });
```

 - The old way (using the `canManageBlogEtcPosts()` method on User.php) will still work but it is not recommended. At some point in the future it will be removed.
 
 (Readme on webdevetc.com will be updated soon)
                                                                                           
## Blog Package for Laravel                                                                                           

This is [WebDevEtc's](https://webdevetc.com/) [BlogEtc Blog package for Laravel](https://webdevetc.com/blogetc). It has everything you need to quickly and easily add a blog to your laravel app.

### For installation instructions please read [the Laravel blog install guide here](https://webdevetc.com/laravel/packages/blogetc-blog-system-for-your-laravel-app/help-documentation/laravel-blog-package-blogetc#install_guide)

- **< 5 minute install time** and your blog is up and working, ready for you to go to the admin panel and write a blog post - see full details below, but this is a summary of the required steps:
   - install with composer,
   - do the database migration, copy the config file over (done with `php artisan vendor:publish`)
   - chmod/chown the `public/blog_images/` directory so featured images can be uploaded for each blog post
   - and then add a gate to AuthServiceProvider (see note above)
   - __but please see the install instructions to get everything up and working__

## How to customise the blog views/templates

This is easy to do, and further details can be found in our  [BlogEtc Laravel Blog Package Documentation](https://webdevetc.com/laravel/packages/blogetc-blog-system-for-your-laravel-app/help-documentation/laravel-blog-package-blogetc#guide_to_views).

After running the `vendor:publish` command, all of the default template files will be found in `/resources/views/vendor/blogetc/` and are easy to edit to match your needs.

## Missing /auth/register?

If you are installing on a fresh install of Laravel (which no longer includes auth built in) then the following must be ran:
 
```
composer require laravel/ui;
php artisan ui vue --auth;
```

## Versions

- **8.4** (Sept 2020): Added support for Laravel 8. Removed support for PHP 7.2
- **8.3** (Sept 2020): Removed support for `swisnl/laravel-fulltext` as it seems abandoned. 
  - Searching in blogetc is now much more simple - it is all inline in the controller and does a simple LIKE query. 
  - If you need full text search then I recommend you implement your own search controller (see older commits to copy code that used full text search)
- **8.2** (Sept 2020): Added fix for dynamic title
- **< 8.1** Support for PHP 7.2, 7.3, 7.4. Support for Lavavel 5.8.35 - 7.6
